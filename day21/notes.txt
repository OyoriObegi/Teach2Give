End to End API with Auth Guards

1. Introduction
    - End to end API testing ensures that the entire flow of the application is working as expected.
    - Auth Guards are used to protect routes and ensure that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.

2. Setting Up
    - Install necessary packages for API testing (e.g., Jest, Supertest).
    - Set up authentication middleware to handle user authentication.

3. Creating Auth Guards
    - Implement Auth Guards to check if a user is authenticated before allowing access to protected routes.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      function authGuard(req, res, next) {
         if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
            return next();
         }
         res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
      }
      ```

4. Writing Tests
    - Write tests to ensure that only authenticated users can access protected routes.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      const request = require('supertest');
      const app = require('../app');

      describe('Protected Routes', () => {
         it('should return 401 for unauthenticated users', async () => {
            const res = await request(app).get('/protected-route');
            expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(401);
         });

         it('should allow access for authenticated users', async () => {
            const agent = request.agent(app);
            await agent.post('/login').send({ username: 'user', password: 'pass' });
            const res = await agent.get('/protected-route');
            expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(200);
         });
      });
      ```

5. Conclusion
    - End to end API testing with Auth Guards ensures that your application is secure and functioning correctly.
    - Regularly update and maintain tests to cover new features and changes in authentication logic.
