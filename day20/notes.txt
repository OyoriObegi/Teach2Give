// Today we are learning about controllers and async handlers
What are controllers?
Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning responses to the client. 
They act as an intermediary between the client and the server-side logic, often interacting with services, repositories, or other components to fulfill the request.

What are async handlers?
Async handlers are functions that handle asynchronous operations, such as database queries or API calls, without blocking the execution of the program. 
They allow the server to handle multiple requests concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.
